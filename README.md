# seventh-project
Look at this files, I don't know what I was thinking.
I broke a lot of rule's design with this project.
Here, I Learned that the index file always must to be in the root folder.
Never use in your folder's name combination between uppercase and lowercase.
CSS must have its own folder.
About design, colors and structure, I think it is a clear sample of how does not do it.
By the way, people say "we learn from our mistake".
This it was a big mistake.
